# Simulation-DynamicalSystems
This repository holds a few simulations for both Linear and Non-linear dynamical systems in Matlab code.
Feel free to play around with the code and reproduce modifications of it for any purpose. This package is meant to serve as an illustrative introduction to Linear Dynamical Systems and Simulation of linear/non-linear dynamical systems through simple simulations.  <br/>

This package also hosts a Pogo-stick and a single plane drone model which differ from the previous examples.   <br/>
The Pogo-stick is a hybrid dynamical systems with two modes -  

• aerial phase: a rigid body in free-fall.    

• ground phase: a Linear Spring-Mass-Damper system having an initial velocity vertically.    

Note: This is just a simple representation of such a system using Matlab's in-built ODE45 integration scheme. It is meant to be a starting point for people interested in exploring further and there are more sophsiticated ways to integrate such systems.

The Single-plane drone model is a non-linear system which in our case is linearized and linear counterpart is simulated. You can go ahead and simulate the actual non-linear system for the same input thrusts. <br/>

Thank you and have fun!! :))
